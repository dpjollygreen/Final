This is a hot and cold game.  You are attempting to guess a random number between 1 and 100 in competition with other players.  Guess the number to be relieved of the hot potato.  You will receive a hint as to whether you are closer (hot) or further (cold) than the previous guess.  There's no escape, someone's got to hold the hot potato.  Polly the parrot was inspired by early issues in coding and he loves potato's.
